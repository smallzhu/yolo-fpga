## Software Simulation For YOLOv2 Accelerator in vs2012
 Considering that Vivado HLS C-Simulation is very slow, I usually simulate the code with vscode. From this, you could also quantize the data precison from float-32 to fixed-16. In addition, you could change the hardware parameters in python script to design different accelerators.
 
Just follow the README.md in each folder.
